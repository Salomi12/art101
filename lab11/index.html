					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to work with jQuery and libraries. We are to get used to light javascript library 
					that allows for us to use more readable syntax within javascript while manipulating the DOM. Brief steps of this challenge 
					included linking the newest version of Jquery onto the index.html and using Jquery syntax to manipulate certain variables and 
					DOM.In addition, we were to create a jQuery event listener to each section. 
					</p>

			<div id="problems" class="sectionbox">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The main issues I faced included downloading the correct version of jQuery, being unable to load the preffered performance
						of the button to highlight each section. I did have some issues with using the correct jQuery syntax, it took some getting used, 
						mainly trial and error before I was able to finally get it right.
                    </p>
					

			</div>

			<div id="output" class="sectionbox"> 
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I was able to include the separate buttons for each section that would also highlight once pressed. 
						Users are able to see this action once the preferred button is clicked. </p>
