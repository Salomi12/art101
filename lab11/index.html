			<h1>Lab 11 -  </h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to work with anon functions and getting comfortable with callbacks. Many 
					of the callbacks worked with anonymous function used on numbers that were included as my array.	 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems that arose included having the right syntax with callbacks and making sure I had brackets and
						parenthesis when calling back and array. I also came across the issue of printing my javascript file onto my
						page. I was able to sorth this issue through going over videos and experimenting through trial and error.
				
                    </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assignment was quite difficult to maneuver through. I was able to finally get more comfortable with
						the main purpose of the challenge after a few tries and researching solutions. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I was able to include the output in the console. Below showcases what the console will reveal. </p>
