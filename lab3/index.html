		<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>

		<div>

		<p> The idea of this lab was to create a local file structure on my computer and
			add it onto and index.html file. 
		</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		
		<p> Creating files were extremely difficult to navigate and inputing an image from my desktop onto 
			the page was also difficult. In addition, I had issues implementing the correct links to the files.
		</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>

		<p> 
			I was able to put together my local file strucutre onto an index.html file and load it on a web browser
		</p>
