					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The purpose of this lab was to get us used experimenting with Ajax and jQuery. The main purpose was to locate the 
						end point using API's and distinguishing the url. In addition, there is an emphasis on using correct syntax where Json 
						and Api are also seen. I was to add a click button that loads the output from API, thanks to the help of Ajax. Essentially,
					    this occurs because I was able to give a road map used within Ajax to deliver this output. For the site that I used, I located 
						the endpoint through copying the API provided and attached it to the url. I then pasted this onto the different steps included in AJAX
					    to help print out the output. This included URL,type, and no data was provided. Later the answer and image was printed in the output section
						with the use of var and appendchild.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems that I came across in this lab was inputting the correct endpoint. I also had some difficulty 
						understanding some concepts and correct syntax to use but found the Yuja videos to be extremely helpful.

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I was able to include the output from the API under this section of the webpage. </p>
