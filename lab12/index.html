			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to work with conditionals and build upon syntax of jQuery.The conditionals used for this lab followed that 
						if names with a certain length were inputted, the result would be due to that number and corresponding house it would fall under. I had
						 to use this same ruling and follow with correct jQuery syntax to print out results. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had many issues regarding following conditionals and printing out using consistent jQuery coding.I was
						able to get a clear answer through videos , w3schools, and solutions provided on class discord.

				
                    </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I was able to include the output of functions that result in the selection of a user's house depending on the 
						conditionals with a unique page aesthetic.
