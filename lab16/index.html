			<h1> Lab 16 -JSON and APIs (XKCD comic!) </h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to work with JSON using API. We were to build upon the last lab and AJAXS structure
						to help with JSON.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems that arose were inputting the right syntax in javascript. I was thoroughly confused with how I was supposed
						to obtain the api key when the page offered in the lab itself did not necessarily need one. I also had much struggle understanding
						where I was to provide the different section titles. I did try to follow along with the code presented but was unsuccessful at completing
						the assignment.
                    </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I implemented a fitting background within the topic of the comic provided in the URL that you will see in my Javascript. </p>
