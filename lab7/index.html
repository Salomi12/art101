			<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to work with functions and manipulate strings to form onto a page. 
						We were assigned to create a new lab 7 folder prior to beginning the main challenge. Within this
                        new file we added a css, index.html file and a javascript program in the lab 7 folder.
						 
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems that arose included having to navigate the best way to add folders in a certain order.
                        I found myself adding a folder instead of a file within that specific folder. I was able to resolve
                        this issue from experimenting a couple of times until I got it right. 
                    </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assignment was quite difficult to maneuver through. I am still a bit uncomfortable with manipulating
                        functions. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I was able to include my script output of the sorted string within my username onto my result.</p>

					    <h3>Script Output</h3>
                        <script src="js/lab7.js"></script>
