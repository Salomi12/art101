			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to work with javascript events and converting arrays. In order to complete this 
						challenge, we needed to upload an index.html file that included an input form field. In addition, this lab implements
						functions such as nameSort() and event listener inorder to obtain values from input field and saves results.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems that arose included having the correct syntax for sorted Arrays functions and making sure it uploads correctly 
						on the webpage. I also had issues printing the sorted username onto the bottom of my results instead of taking over the actual
						title of the section. </p>
			</div>

			
			<div id="output">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I was able to include the button element below and retrieve the user's sorted username include in the box after clicking. </p>

				
		    </div>

			<label for="user-name">Input your name:</label>
			<input type="text" id="user-name"><br>
			<button id="my-button">Submit</button>
