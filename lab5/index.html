					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to work with javascript data types and variables.
						We were assigned to create a console contents, create a javascript program in the lab 5 folder,
						while also linking index.html and CSS. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems that arose included having to clear jawscript console due to making a mistake and 
						having to clear out from the console and begin again. This occured numerous times, but I was able
						get a hang of it after a few tries. I also had an issue with minimizing an image onto the Results section 
						but managed to get by through experimentation on CSS file attached. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assignment was a nice way to put in practice for using Javascript and honing in my skills on 
						CSS and having a smoother process of uploading my file onto 
						Github. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I was able to include my Script Output onto my result.</p>
