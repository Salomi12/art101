			<h1> Lab 14: Debugging Tools and Strategies </h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to get comfortable with debugging and using tools to efficiently debug labs. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some issues I found with debugging previous labs was to correctly read the syntax and find the error. Ways that
						I have remedied these solutions is by using certain techniques like console.log onto inspector or button clicked to 
						see if these functions are working. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I was able to debug some labs from this course and resubmit onto canvas. </p>

					<h2>Debugging</h2>
					<p>Looking at my inspector console, I noticed that lab two had an error on lab 2. I was able to read the line
					in which the error occured which was the image I inputed onto the page had not properly loaded.Here is a picture
					of the conflict and my resolved and updated page. Essentially, In the lab, I was not able to input the correct image
					src and add the correct id link onto my css page. I was able to go back and fix these issues for the image to correctly pop up
					 where I would have like it to.
